## Lesson 2 Assignment: Data Structures and File Handling
### Python Operators, Control Flow, and Calculator Implementation

**Objective:** In this assignment, you will practice using Python operators, control flow statements, and implement a simple calculator with a loop. Complete the tasks below, modifying the provided code where needed and adding your own implementations.

### **Task 1: Arithmetic Operations**
1. Create a function called `perform_operations` that takes two arguments (`a` and `b`).

2. Implement the following arithmetic operations inside the function and print the results:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division (handle the case where `b` is zero)
   - Floor Division (handle the case where `b` is zero)
   - Modulus (handle the case where `b` is zero)
   - Exponentiation

3. Call the function with example values `a = 10` and `b = 3` and print the results.

### **Task 2: Comparison Operations**
1. Create a function called `compare_numbers` that takes two arguments (`a` and `b`).

2. Implement the following comparison operations inside the function and print the results:
   - Equality (`==`)
   - Inequality (`!=`)
   - Greater than (`>`)
   - Less than (`<`)
   - Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
   - Less than or equal to (`<=`)

3. Call the function with example values `a = 10` and `b = 3` and print the results.

### **Task 3: Calculator with User Input**
1. Create a function called `calculator` that continuously asks the user for two numbers and an operation until they decide to quit.

2. Implement the following features inside the function:
   - Ask the user to input two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).
   - Ask the user to input an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) or `q` to quit the calculator.
   - Perform the requested operation and print the result.
   - Handle division by zero when the user inputs `/` and `num2` is zero.
   - Handle invalid inputs using a `try-except` block to ensure the user inputs valid numbers.

3. Call the `calculator` function to allow the user to perform calculations.

### **Task 4: Working with Lists and Loops**  
1. **Create a list of five integers** and print it.  
2. **Use a loop to print each number and its square**, like:  
   ```
   1: 1  
   2: 4  
   3: 9  
   4: 16  
   5: 25  
   ```  
3. **Calculate and print the sum** of the numbers in the list.

### **Task 5: File Handling**  
1. **Create a file `numbers.txt`** and write numbers to it (one per line).  
2. **Read the file contents**, convert them back to integers, and store them in a list.  
3. **Calculate and print the sum** of the numbers in the list.
