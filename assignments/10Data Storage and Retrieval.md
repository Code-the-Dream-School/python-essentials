# **Lesson 10: Data Storage and Retrieval**

---

## **Assignment 1: Storing Data in JSON**
1. Write a script to scrape data from another Wikipedia page of your choice.
2. Save the scraped data (title, headers, and links) into a JSON file.
3. Open the JSON file and verify its contents.

---

## **Assignment 2: Storing Data in CSV**
1. Modify the script to include additional data (e.g., image sources).
2. Save the new data to a CSV file.
3. Test your script and verify the output.

---

## **Assignment 3: Storing Data in Databases**
1. Create a new SQLite database table for storing scraped data from a different page.
2. Insert the data into the table using Python.
3. Retrieve and print the data from the database.

---

## **Assignment 4: Data Retrieval and Analysis with Pandas**
1. Load the stored data from your SQLite database into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Perform the following analyses:
   - Count the number of headers and links.
   - Find the most frequent type of data.
3. Write a short summary of your findings.

---

## **Assignment 5: Optimizing Data Storage**
1. Research and write a short comparison between relational databases (e.g., SQLite) and non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB).
2. Discuss which type of storage would be more suitable for:
   - A small-scale project like scraping Wikipedia.
   - A large-scale project involving millions of records.
