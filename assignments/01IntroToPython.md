### üéôÔ∏è Podcast: Lesson 1

We‚Äôre excited to introduce a new optional resource to support your learning‚Äî**short, mentor-style podcast episodes that break down key assignments and concepts in a friendly, approachable way.**

If you ever feel stuck, want a quick refresher before diving in, or just prefer listening over reading, these episodes are here to help! They‚Äôll cover **how to approach your assignment, common tricky spots, and why these skills matter‚Äîall in a quick, easy-to-digest format**.

**These podcasts are generated by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)** ‚Äî a new tool we're still exploring. Let us know if these are helpful, and happy coding!

## **Instructions**

### **Setup**

Your homework for this and some future assignments will use a special python homework repository, so that it can be submitted using git.  That repository is [here.](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/python_homework)  Click on the link, and carefully **follow the instructions in the README**.  You will then have your own copy of the repository, connected to your GitHub account.  You create the program files for the homework in the root of that repository.  For each assignment, you create a separate git branch.  When you have completed your assignment, you add and commit your changes in that branch, push it to your GitHub, and create a pull request for that branch.  You provide a link to that pull request when you submit your homework.  Your instructor will review it, approving or requesting changes.  Once your instructor has approved the pull request, you can merge it.

### **Step 1: Complete the Coding Tasks**  

At the outset, you create python `.py` files.  In some future lessons, you will create Jupyter notebooks. Homework for this assignment is created within your `python_homework` folder.  Be sure to create an `assignment1` git branch.  Then, write Python code to complete the following tasks.  As you do, put in **comment lines to mark your code for Task 1, Task 2, and so on.** That will help your reviewer.

### **Task 1: Data Type Conversion**  
In the homework repository, create a file `data_type_conversion.py`.   It should do the following.
1. **Create a variable `num_str`** and assign it a string value representing a number (e.g., `"25"`).  
2. **Convert `num_str` to an integer** and perform an arithmetic operation using another variable, `age`. Print the result.  
3. **Convert a float (`height`) to a string**, concatenate it with another string (e.g., `" meters"`), and print the result.  
4. **Convert an integer (`age`) to a float** and print the result.  

---

### **Task 2: Simple Calculator** 
Create a file `calc.py` with the following. 
1. **Ask the user for two numbers** (`num1` and `num2`).  
2. **Perform basic arithmetic operations** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
3. **Handle errors for division by zero** and display an appropriate message.  
4. **Print the results** of all operations.  

---

### **Task 3: Grading System** 
Create a file `grade.py` with the following. 
1. **Ask the user to enter their score** (as a float).  
2. **Determine the letter grade** based on the following scale:  
   - A: 90 and above  
   - B: 80-89  
   - C: 70-79  
   - D: 60-69  
   - F: Below 60  
3. **Print the assigned grade**.  
4. **Allow the user to enter multiple scores**, store them in a list, calculate the average, and display the corresponding letter grade.  

---

### **Task 4: Function to Calculate Average**  
Create a file `average.py` that contains the following.
1. **Create a function `calculate_average`** that takes a list of numbers as input.  
2. **Calculate and return the average** of the numbers in the list. If the list is empty, return 0.  
3. **Test the function** with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and print the result.  
4. **Validate input data** to ensure the list contains only numeric values. Print an error message if invalid data is found.  

---
Modify the file `calc.py` to add the following.
### **Task 5: Calculator with Error Handling**  
1. **Create a function `divide_numbers(num1, num2)`** that divides two numbers.  
2. **Use a `try-except` block** to handle division by zero and return an error message if needed.  
3. **Test the function** with user input.  
4. **Extend error handling** to catch other errors, such as non-numeric input.  

---

### **Step 2: Submit Your Assignment on GitHub**  

**Follow these steps to submit your work:**  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Add, Commit, and Push Your Changes**  
- Within your python_homework folder, do a git add and a git commit for the files you have created, so that they are added to the `assignment1` branch.
- Push that branch to GitHub. 

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Pull Request**  
- Log on to your GitHub account.
- Open your `python_homework` repository.
- Select your `assignment1` branch.  It should be one or several commits ahead of your main branch.
- Create a pull request.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Submit Your GitHub Link**  
- Your browser now has the link to your pull request.  Copy that link. 
- Paste the URL into the **assignment submission form**.  

## **üéâ Well Done!**
