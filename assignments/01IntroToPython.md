### üéôÔ∏è Podcast: Lesson 1

We‚Äôre excited to introduce a new optional resource to support your learning‚Äî**short, mentor-style podcast episodes that break down key assignments and concepts in a friendly, approachable way.**

If you ever feel stuck, want a quick refresher before diving in, or just prefer listening over reading, these episodes are here to help! They‚Äôll cover **how to approach your assignment, common tricky spots, and why these skills matter‚Äîall in a quick, easy-to-digest format**.

**These podcasts are generated by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)** ‚Äî a new tool we're still exploring. Let us know if these are helpful, and happy coding!

## **Instructions**  

### **Step 1: Complete the Coding Tasks**  
Write your Python code to complete the following tasks. In **Python Essentials and Analysis**, you can work in a Python file (`.py`) or a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`). We recommend starting out with `.py` files ‚Äî we'll teach you Jupyter notebooks later in the course.

---

### **Task 1: Data Type Conversion**  
1. **Create a variable `num_str`** and assign it a string value representing a number (e.g., `"25"`).  
2. **Convert `num_str` to an integer** and perform an arithmetic operation using another variable, `age`. Print the result.  
3. **Convert a float (`height`) to a string**, concatenate it with another string (e.g., `" meters"`), and print the result.  
4. **Convert an integer (`age`) to a float** and print the result.  

---

### **Task 2: Simple Calculator**  
1. **Ask the user for two numbers** (`num1` and `num2`).  
2. **Perform basic arithmetic operations** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
3. **Handle errors for division by zero** and display an appropriate message.  
4. **Print the results** of all operations.  

---

### **Task 3: Grading System**  
1. **Ask the user to enter their score** (as a float).  
2. **Determine the letter grade** based on the following scale:  
   - A: 90 and above  
   - B: 80-89  
   - C: 70-79  
   - D: 60-69  
   - F: Below 60  
3. **Print the assigned grade**.  
4. **Allow the user to enter multiple scores**, store them in a list, calculate the average, and display the corresponding letter grade.  

---

### **Task 4: Function to Calculate Average**  
1. **Create a function `calculate_average`** that takes a list of numbers as input.  
2. **Calculate and return the average** of the numbers in the list. If the list is empty, return 0.  
3. **Test the function** with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and print the result.  
4. **Validate input data** to ensure the list contains only numeric values. Print an error message if invalid data is found.  

---

### **Task 5: Calculator with Error Handling**  
1. **Create a function `divide_numbers(num1, num2)`** that divides two numbers.  
2. **Use a `try-except` block** to handle division by zero and return an error message if needed.  
3. **Test the function** with user input.  
4. **Extend error handling** to catch other errors, such as non-numeric input.  

---

### **Task 6: Working with Lists and Loops**  
1. **Create a list of five integers** and print it.  
2. **Use a loop to print each number and its square**, like:  
   ```
   1: 1  
   2: 4  
   3: 9  
   4: 16  
   5: 25  
   ```  
3. **Calculate and print the sum** of the numbers in the list.  

---

### **Task 7: File Handling**  
1. **Create a file `numbers.txt`** and write numbers to it (one per line).  
2. **Read the file contents**, convert them back to integers, and store them in a list.  
3. **Calculate and print the sum** of the numbers in the list.

### **Step 2: Submit Your Assignment on GitHub**  

**Follow these steps to submit your work:**  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a GitHub Repository**  
- Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com).  
- Click **+ (New repository)** in the top-right corner.  
- Name it: `python-class-your-name` *(replace "your-name" with your first and last name).*  
- Keep it **Public** and **check to add a `README` file**. Click **Create repository**.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Your Assignment**  
- Go to your new repository.  
- Click the **Add file** dropdown and select **Create new file**.  
- Name it `lesson-01/assignment.py` (or `lesson-01/assignment.ipynb` for a Jupyter Notebook).  
- Paste your code into the file OR click **Upload files** and add your `.py` or `.ipynb` file.  
- Click **Commit new file** to save your work.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Submit Your GitHub Link**  
- Open your repository and navigate to the `lesson-01` folder.  
- Copy the URL of the folder (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/python-class-your-name/tree/main/lesson-01`).  
- Paste the URL into the **assignment submission form**.
