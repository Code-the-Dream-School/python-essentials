## Lesson 4 Assignment ‚Äî Data Wrangling and Manipulation
### Advanced Data Wrangling and Aggregation with Pandas

### **Objective:**
The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of data wrangling and aggregation using the Pandas library in Python. You will work with sample DataFrames to perform various operations such as filtering, handling missing values, merging, sorting, transforming, and creating pivot tables.

### **Tasks:**

### **Task 1: Data Selection**
1. **Create two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the provided sample data(feel free to change the values):**
   - `df1` contains names, ages, and salaries of five employees.
   - `df2` contains names, ages, and salaries of five other employees.
   - Display both DataFrames.
   
```
data1 = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eva'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40, 30],
    'Salary': [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000, 55000]
}
```

```
data2 = {
    'Name': ['Frank', 'Grace', 'Helen', 'Ian', 'Jack'],
    'Age': [28, 33, 35, 29, 40],
    'Salary': [52000, 58000, 72000, 61000, 85000]
}

```
2. **Perform the following selection operations on `df1`:**
   - Select the 'Name' column.
   - Select both 'Name' and 'Salary' columns.
   - Slice the first three rows using integer-based indexing (`iloc`).

### **Task 2: Data Aggregation**
1. **Group `df1` by 'Age' and aggregate the 'Salary' column:**
   - Calculate the mean, sum, and count of the salary for each age group.
   - Display the aggregated results.

### **Task 3: Merging and Joining DataFrames**
1. **Merge `df1` and `df2` on the 'Name' column:**
   - Use an outer join to combine the two DataFrames and handle any missing data.
   - Use the suffixes `_df1` and `_df2` to differentiate columns from each DataFrame.

2. **Join `df1` and `df2` using the `join()` method:**
   - Set 'Name' as the index before joining the DataFrames.
   - Display the joined DataFrame with outer join logic.

### **Task 4: Filtering Rows Based on Conditions**
1. **Filter rows in `df1` where 'Age' is greater than 30:**
   - Display the filtered rows.

### **Task 5: Handling Missing Values**
1. **Handle missing values in the merged DataFrame:**
   - Replace any `NaN` values with 0.
   - Display the updated DataFrame.

### **Task 6: Sorting Data**
1. **Sort `df1` by the 'Salary' column in descending order:**
   - Display the sorted DataFrame.

### **Task 7: Renaming Columns**
1. **Rename columns in `df1`:**
   - Rename 'Age' to 'Employee Age' and 'Salary' to 'Employee Salary'.
   - Display the DataFrame with the renamed columns.

### **Task 8: Creating a Pivot Table**
1. **Create a pivot table for `df1`:**
   - Use 'Age' as the index and 'Salary' as the value.
   - Aggregate the salary using the mean function.
   - Display the pivot table.

**Hint:** Use the `pivot_table()` function in Pandas, setting 'Age' as the index and 'Salary' as the values. Aggregate the salary using the mean function.

### **Task 9: Data Transformation**
1. **Apply a transformation to the 'Salary' column in `df1`:**
   - Increase the salary by 10% for each employee.
   - Display the updated DataFrame.

### **Task 10: Concatenating DataFrames**
1. **Concatenate `df1` and `df2` along rows:**
   - Reset the index before concatenating and display the concatenated DataFrame.

### **Task 11: Cross Tabulation**
1. **Create a cross-tabulation of ages in the concatenated DataFrame:**
   - Display the frequency of each age for different names.
