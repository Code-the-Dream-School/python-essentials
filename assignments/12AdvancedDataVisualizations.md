## **Task 1: Plotting with Pandas**
1. Load a dataset of your choice (e.g., CSV or a built-in Pandas dataset).
2. Use Pandas' built-in plotting functionality to:
   - Create a line plot for two or more columns.
   - Create a bar plot for a single column.
3. Customize the plots with appropriate titles, labels, and colors.

## **Task 2: Interactive Visualizations with Plotly**
1. Create an interactive scatter plot using Plotly for a dataset of your choice.
   - Include additional features like color coding based on another column.
2. Add interactivity (e.g., hover tooltips) and customize the visualization.
3. Save the Plotly visualization as an HTML file.

## **Task 3: Building Dashboards with Dash**
1. Create a simple dashboard using Dash with the following components:
   - A dropdown menu to select different metrics from a dataset.
   - A dynamic graph that updates based on the selected metric.
2. Use a dataset with at least three numerical columns to provide options for the dropdown.
3. Run the dashboard and test its interactivity.

## **Task 4: Reflection**
1. Reflect on the differences between static and interactive visualizations.
2. Write a short paragraph discussing the advantages of using dashboards for real-time data exploration.
3. Explain how interactive tools like Plotly and Dash can improve data communication in professional settings.

## **Task 5: Extension Task(Optional)**
1. Extend the dashboard to include:
   - A date range selector for filtering data.
   - Multiple charts displayed simultaneously (e.g., line and bar charts side by side).
2. Document your extended dashboard setup and discuss its applications in business or research.
